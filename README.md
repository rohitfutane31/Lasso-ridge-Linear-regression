Lasso and Ridge Regression
Lasso Ridge Regression is a type of regularized linear regression that combines the benefits of both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization techniques. This hybrid approach offers a more flexible and effective way to address overfitting and feature selection in linear regression models.

Key Characteristics:

Combines L1 and L2 
regularization: Lasso Ridge Regression incorporates both the absolute value (L1) and squared value (L2) penalties,
allowing for simultaneous shrinkage and feature selection.
Shrinks coefficients: Like Ridge Regression, Lasso Ridge Regression reduces the magnitude of coefficients, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.

Selects features: The L1 penalty term in Lasso Ridge Regression sets some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating irrelevant features and reducing model complexity.
Tuning parameter: The regularization strength is controlled by a single hyperparameter, which balances the trade-off between shrinkage and feature selection.
When to Use:
Large datasets: Lasso Ridge Regression is suitable for datasets with many features and a large number of instances, where feature selection is crucial.
High-dimensional data: This hybrid approach is effective when dealing with high-dimensional data, where many features are correlated or redundant.
Non-linear relationships: Lasso Ridge Regression can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, making it a versatile choice.

Advantages:

Improved feature selection: Lasso Ridge Regression can identify and eliminate irrelevant features, reducing model complexity and improving interpretability.
Enhanced generalization: The combined regularization approach helps to prevent overfitting and improves the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to new data.
Flexibility: The single hyperparameter allows for easy tuning and adaptation to different problem settings.
